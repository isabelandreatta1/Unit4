## Link to all my HTML pages 

Considering that Github allows hosting static websites for free, I thought it would be easier to just postt all the websites we create on github.io so it is more interactive than just taking a screenshot. Unfortunately, Github only supports html, no other languages like Java, so I only published the simple webpages I created and not my quizzes. 

You can find the repository which holds all my web pages here: https://github.com/isabelandreatta1/isabelandreatta1.github.io.

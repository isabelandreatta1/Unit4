## Link to all my HTML pages 

Considering that Github allows hosting static websites for free, I thought it would be easier to just postt all the websites we create on github.io so it is more interactive than just taking a screenshot. Unfortunately, Github only supports html, no other languages like Java, so I only published the simple webpages I created and not my quizzes. 


### 1. My Profile Webpage 

*Maybe scroll down to see suprirse*

https://isabelandreatta1.github.io/

### 2. Key Definitions of Important Terms

### 4. LAN built in class

# Network Notes 

### Different types of networks 
Order from smallest to largest access 

1. PAN: personal area network (personal level, wireless technolog or wire connection, transfer small files e.g. music and files) 
1. LAN: local area network, group of devices in same building or close proximity, most common is ethernet lan using a switch
1. WLAN: wireless lan, at least two devices that use wireless connection to create a LAN (wifi router) 
1. CAN: Campus area network, joins 2 LANS together within limited area (e.g. university w different departments) 
1. MAN: Metropolitan Area network, connected thru high speed connection like fiber optic network, shared data within city 
1. SAN: storage Area network, high speed network, provides access to a lot of data, uses switches, disk arrays, servers, not affected by network traffic (or bottlenecks) cause theyre not in LAN, theyre cut off 
1. WAN: Wide area network, largest type, country/continent/global, internet is example 

### Differences between Moden and Router 

- Modem brings internet to home/business, maintains connection to internet service provider, computer only reads digital signals, while internet uses only analog signals, moden converts between the two (modulates and demodulates) 
- word Modem = modulator and demodulator 
- Router comes in after modem, diff types of routers but do same thing, routers pass internet connection to all devices, common example is router with multiple switch so you can connect many devices at once, and wireless access point. Technically dont need router bc you can just connect one device to modem. 
- Different types of modens: cable (colaxial cable e.g. television) and DSL (thruu phone line), internet modens are usually a hybrid
- Most routers have integrated switch, you only need switch if you need more wire connections 

### Firewalls 

- prevents unathorised access from private network (safety barrier)
- especially important to large organisation with data servers
- stops harmful activity before
- filters access control point, based on certain rules (admin decides)
- allows or denies permissions
- E.g.  based on IP address, domain name, protocols, programs, ports, key words
- Host-based firewall, firewall that is installed on computer/device, protects that one device only (can come with comp default or can download from third party)
- NEtwork firewall, mix of hardware and software,  protects entire network
- can be stand alone firewall (used for big cooperations), can be integrated within router, or can have cloud firewall
